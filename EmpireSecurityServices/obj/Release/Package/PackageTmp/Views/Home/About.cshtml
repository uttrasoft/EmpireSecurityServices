    <p>
        ESS Security will build a competitive edge through high levels of customer service and assurance. The company will strive to
        not be a broker between clients and contracted security guards, as some security guard providers become, but instead be a
        partner in the security and prolledion of client's assets, with security guards as a major tool in that protection. This strategy
        will require ESS to carefully audit a client's security situation and to work with them on plans to upgrade and maintain that
        security. We at ESS will continually check in with clients and with the guards sent to client sites to learn about the challenges
        they are facing.
